//Write a function that takes in an array of receipt totals 
//(integers) and returns an array of the same totals with added 
//sales tax % (use your local tax %). Format the numbers in the resulting 
//array to have 2 digits after decimal point (i.e. 12.23456 > 12.23) and 
//make sure your array values are still numbers.
//For example: [342, 1002, 523] should become [371.92, 1089.67, 568.76]
// , given the tax of 8.875%.
//Put this function into a separate mocha file, similar 
//to the fahrenheitToCelsius function above and add basic test coverage.
